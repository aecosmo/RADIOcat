The files contain a set of codes for making a mosaic from radio images. Here, I have used uGMRT band 2 images centered on a single frequency of 147.4 MHz. 
The following packages are required: Astropy, pybdsf, CASA, and aegean (for completeness correction only). 
You can use these codes to make a mosaic, build a source catalogue, classify point-like and extend sources, and compute source counts with necessary corrections such as false detection rate, completeness, and visibility area. 
Necessary images can be requested from the developer (me) and the collaborators. 
The TGSS, GLEAM, and GLEAM-X are available in the Vizier Astronomical database. The uGMRT catalogue is present in the directory, and will soon be moved to Vizier.
